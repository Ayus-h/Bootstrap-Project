  <h3>ENDANGERED ANIMAL : NEPAL</h3>
  <p><em>INTRODUCTION : Some CITES Listed Wildlife</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left;">Because of heavy smuggling, Nepal has been facing the extreme problem of endangered animals. As per research on the internet,from the year 1950 to 1980, Nepal has lost half of its forest cover. Due to the increase in population, the people cleared forest and make home and rooms for their family. Today less than 30% of the total land of Nepal is covered with forest. Furthermore, the practice of livelihood farming has put great pressure on the forest lands and wild animals. These, attended by the increasing problems of smuggling have meant that several species of animals have become endangered in Nepal.</p>

        <p>The greater one-horned rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis), also known as the Indian rhinoceros, is a grey giant, second only to an elephant in size. An adult rhino usually weighs between 2-2.5 metric tonnes. Rhinos usually lead a solitary life, but they may also graze and wallow together. Calves follow their mothers for 1-3 years. Females are sexually mature between 5 and 7 years old, while males mature at about 10 years of age.</p>
        <p>The greater one-horned rhino (or “Indian rhino”) is the largest of the rhino species. Once widespread across the entire northern part of the Indian sub-continent, rhino populations plummeted as they were hunted for sport or killed as agricultural pests. This pushed the species very close to extinction and by the end of the 20th century, fewer than 200 animals remained.</p>
<p>
The recovery of the greater one-horned rhino is among the greatest conservation success stories in Asia. Thanks to strict protection and management from Indian and Nepalese wildlife authorities, the greater one-horned rhino was brought back from the brink. Today populations have increased to around 3,500 rhinos in northeastern India and the Terai grasslands of Nepal.</p>
<p>
The greater one-horned rhino is identified by a single black horn about 8-25 inches long and a grey-brown hide with skin folds, which gives it an armor-plated appearance. The species is solitary, except when adult males or rhinos nearing adulthood gather at wallows or to graze. Males have loosely defined home ranges that are not well defended and often overlap. They primarily graze, with a diet consisting almost entirely of grasses as well as leaves, branches of shrubs and trees, fruit, and aquatic plants.</p>

          <p>Ailurus fulgens</p>

        <p>Red pandas are tree-dwelling mammals native to the temperate forests of the Himalayas. Because of their interesting reddish fur, striped tails and expressive faces, they are very popular animals in their native Asia and have been featured in cartoons, as toys and as mascots. However, red pandas are also critically endangered. Human actions, such as deforestation, poaching, accidental trapping and an illegal pet trade have caused the wild population of red pandas to shrink to just around 10,000 individuals.</p>
        <p>Like almost all endangered animals, loss of habitat is one of the main reasons for red pandas' dwindling numbers. Red panda habitats, namely Himalayan forests, are being cut down at an alarming rate each year. Usually, these forests are cleared due to logging operations or to convert the forested area into farmland where crops can be grown and cattle can graze.</p>
        <p>It may seem unthinkable that someone would purposefully kill endangered animals, but sadly poaching is common enough to be a severe problem for red pandas. Their bright, reddish fur and striped tails make them prime targets for those who would sell their pelts for profit. In certain rural areas, hats made from red panda fur were traditionally worn as good luck tokens for special occasions. Some people insist on carrying on this tradition, despite it being illegal. Poachers also kill red pandas due to the mistaken belief that certain red panda body parts have medicinal properties. Traditional medicines made with red panda body parts are illegal to buy and sell, but a black market trade still exists for these products.</p>
        <p>There's no doubt about it: Red pandas are appealing animals. They're widely considered to be cute and personable. While it is good that people are fascinated by red pandas and want to learn more about them, there is also a downside to red pandas' popularity: namely, people who like red pandas so much that they want to keep them as pets.</p>

        <p>The Bengal tiger, also called the Royal Bengal tiger and scientifically known as Panthera tigris tigris, is found in a profusion of habitats. This majestic predator can be found in high altitudes, tropical and subtropical rainforests, grasslands, and mangroves; their range spreads across Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar and Nepal.</p>
        <p>Humans have made the Bengal tigers' habitat shrink, encroaching on their population and displacing them from their natural homes. Bengal tigers are also seen as threatening for human herders and their livestock and thereby hunted.

At the start of the 20th century, the worldwide tiger population was estimated at 100,000. In just 100 years, the situation has turned for the worst and the survival of the great big cat is now in question.</p>
<p>Bengal tigers also face other human threats such as poachers and hunters, who kill them for their valuable pelt. There is a booming black market trade of this sort of items, with Bengal tiger body parts being used in traditional Asian medicine.</p>
<p>Today, the tigers' habitat range is 20 times smaller than what it was at the start of the 20th century. Between the forties and the eighties, 3 of the 8 tiger subspecies had already disappeared – the Caspian, Bali and Java tiger did not survive hunting, poaching, and deforestation</p>

        <p>A long thin snout, rounded belly, stocky body and large flippers are characteristics of the Ganges River dolphin. Although its eye lacks a lens (this species is also referred to as the "blind dolphin"), the dolphin still uses its eye to locate itself. The species has a slit similar to a blowhole on the top of the head, which acts as a nostril. </p>
        <p>More than 50 dams and irrigation-related projects have had an adverse impact on the habitat of this species. These projects result in major changes in the flow, sediment load, and water quality of rivers, which affects the quality of waters downstream.

As a result, there has been a serious decrease in fish production, while the extraction of river water and siltation from deforestation are also degrading the species' habitat. In some cases, habitat alterations have resulted in the genetic isolation of dolphin populations.</p>
<p>Pollution levels are a problem, and are expected to increase with the development of intensive modern industrial practices in the region. Compounds such as organochlorine and butyltin found in the tissues of Ganges River dolphins are a cause for concern about their potential effects on the subspecies.</p>
<p>Although the killing of this dolphin for meat and oil is thought to have declined, it still occurs in the middle Ganges near Patna, in the Kalni-Kushiyara River of Bangladesh, and in the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra. In fisheries for large catfish in India and Bangladesh, dolphin oil and body parts are used to lure prey, and Ganges River dolphins are used to this end.

        <p>It is a small deer without antlers. About 3 feet high, it weighs from 11-18 kilos. It is sandy brown with a white yellow strip from the throat to the chin. The body slopes forward, as the hind legs are almost a third longer than the forelegs. The ears are large and rounded. Its canine teeth protrude from the mouth. The deer can breed at 2 years of age and usually has just one child born usually in June/July. It can live to 20 years of age.

<p>During the day Himalayan musk deer hide in the forest. They come out at dusk into open areas and graze till dawn. They live as couples in the same home range all their lives. Males scent-mark their territories by rubbing their tail gland against trees and stones.</p>

<p>When frightened, these shy animals leap into the air, and some leaps cover up to 19 feet, often changing direction midleap. They communicate with each other through smell. Primarily silent, musk deer will emit a loud double hiss if alarmed and may scream plaintively if wounded.</p>

<p>Male deer have a scent sac or pod which becomes active when they are about two years old. This sac secretes a substance known as musk; the stag uses it to mark his territory and to attract females. Each musk pod weighs about 15 gm. This tiny pod is what the poacher wants, and he kills the deer to get it.</p>
        <p>Secretions from the scent gland or "pod" of the male musk deer are used in many traditional East Asian medicines to treat a variety of ailments relating to the heart, nerves and breathing. Musk is also used in non-medicinal products such as cosmetics, personal hygiene products, shampoos and detergents. Musk can be produced synthetically, and often is for the non-medicinal products, but natural musk is still preferred in traditional East Asian medicine, and for some perfume manufacturers.</p>

        <p>Clouded leopards face many significant threats in their Southeast Asian homeland. Their forest habitat is experiencing rampant degradation due to industrial logging and the development of agricultural areas.</p>
        <p>In addition to habitat disturbance, the clouded leopard and its prey are targeted by both commercial and subsistence hunters. Because larger wild cat species such as tigers and leopards have mostly been hunted out of their range, clouded leopards are increasingly becoming the targets of commercial poachers seeking their skins, bones, and meat. In one Myanmar market monitored by the conservation group Wildlife Alliance, the number of clouded leopard pelts has increased by 200% in just two years. Many of these products end up being purchased by consumers seeking traditional medicines and exotic fashions in the booming economy of China. Live clouded leopards are also sought by wildlife traders, destined to become pets or join the exotic zoos of wealthy collectors.

        <p>The Himalayan Monal Pheasant (Lophophorus impejanus) is also regionally known as the Impeyan Monal or Impeyan Pheasant.</p>
        <p>It is a bird of the mountains, living between 8,000 and 15,000ft – higher than any other pheasant. It has a relatively wide distribution, being found in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Kashmir, India, Nepal, southern Tibet, China and Bhutan, although its range has been shrinking in recent years.
</p>
        <p>The Impeyan pheasant is not specially endangered, although it is threatened by poaching – both for food and for its impressive crest feathers which have long been used to decorate hats, as a symbol of status and authority. The feathers are still used in the cap badges of the Chitral Scouts.</p><p>

As with many of the pheasant family, its habitat is declining due to human activity. Hydroelectric schemes, for instance, cause disturbance as well as habitat loss.</p>

        <p>This otherwise reclusive bird is best known for its elaborate courtship display, where the male’s black and white plumage is shown off to good effect in short arching display flights, as well as choreographed strutting – with fluffed up neck feathers and a head pumping action, to attract females.</p>
        <p>Bengal Florican is the only member of its genus Houbaropsis, and is the rarest member of the Bustard Order, Ortidiformes. Two thirds of the global population breed in the floodplain of the Tonle Sap Lake, Cambodia; they migrate up to 100km annually to escape the floodwaters in the non-breeding season. Thousands of kilometres away in Nepal and India, there exists another population of the same species which occupies the duars and terai grasslands along the base of the Himalayas. Both populations are in decline and threatened by habitat loss through drainage, conversion to agricultural land and plantations, the invasion of alien species, and damn construction. They are, or were, targeted by hunters for sport and food, leading to their decline.</p>
        <p>Its threats are:Destruction of grasslands for farming, cattle grazing and building habitations, poor habitat management practices such as large-scale burning or creating plantations,
poaching for meat and egg collection(especially in Southeast Asia) and
modification of the hydrological regime in moist grasslands through dam building.</p>

        <p>Cheer pheasant, an endangered species of bird in the world, is likely to vanish for lack of environment conducive and proper habitat in Myagdi.</p><p>

Keshav Chokhal, an MSc student from Tribhuvan University (TU), has carried out his research in the district for a year confirming as high as 60 cheer pheasants living in Myagdi. The total number of the bird is around 1000 in Nepal, he shared.</p>


 <p>
Chokhal conducted his research on situation, number and reasons of extinctions of cheer pheasants in the district with supports from the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC) and other organisations.

Known as Catreus Wallichii as its scientific name, the bird is named Cheer Kaliz in Nepali and Cheddu in the Far-Western regions.</p>
<p>

The bird is enlisted in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Nepal’s National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act as well.
</p>
<p>
Researcher Chokhal said that the bird is found at an altitude of 1400 metres to 3,600 metres. The bird has the special feature of chirping just twice a day, before the sunrise and after the sunset. He said, the endangered birds are spotted on the bank of Kaligandaki River, Myagdi River and Raghu Ganga River in Myagdi and also in neighbouring Baglung district and far-western regions.

Chokhal cited illegal hunting, decline in the habitat and lack of consciousness among people as the reasons for declining its number.</p>

        <p>These pythons are found in a variety of habitats including rainforests, river valleys, woodlands, scrublands, grassy marshes, and semi rocky foothills. They are usually found in habitats with areas that can provide sufficient cover. This species is never found very far from water sources, and seems to prefer very damp terrain</p>
        <p>For centuries, humans have killed pythons out of fear. Snakes of all kinds are also hunted for food, skins, and blood believed to have medicinal values. Live snakes are killed to order in Thai markets so customers can drink the fresh blood, thought to impart vitality. Python and other snake skins are made into fashionable accessories such as purses, shoes, and belts.</p>
<p>
Snakes often are skinned alive so as not to mar the skin and reduce their commercial value. Even before snakeskin boots were fashionable, pythons were considered a trophy species and hunted heavily by Europeans. More recently, they have become sought after for the pet trade and for zoos.
</p><p>

In addition, the python’s jungle habitat is disappearing as trees are cut down for lumber, firewood and to make room for spreading human settlement and agriculture</p>

        <p>Gharials, sometimes called gavials, are a type of Asian crocodilian distinguished by their long, thin snouts. Crocodilians are a group that includes crocodiles, alligators, caimans, and more.</p>
        <p>Since the mid-1900s, the gharial's numbers have declined as much as 98 percent due to hunting for traditional medicine and drastic changes to their freshwater habitats. For instance, people have manipulated the flow of rivers, causing certain areas to dry out and making it more difficult for water-reliant gharials to survive.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature classifies the species as critically endangered.</p>
<p>There are a number of threats to Gharial crocodiles, though the main ones have come in the form of habitat destruction at the hands of human beings. Farming and agriculture, mining, pollution, and general disturbances have all contributed towards the radical decline in Gharial numbers. Even livestock have contributed towards their decline as livestock such as water buffalo and cattle have destroyed and damaged riverbanks, sandbanks and gharial nests by simply grazing.</p>
